# SinkFoundExposerService
This may be just a proof-of-concept class, but it comes handy in tests for sure.

This class runs the `findSink` task in order to find the sink the name of which is given in the Service prophash.

Identity is taken from prophash; defaults to `{name: 'user'; role: 'user'}`.
